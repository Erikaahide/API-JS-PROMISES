# üïµÔ∏è Mini Search App (JSdemo)

A simple JavaScript demo project: a **user search app** that consumes the free [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).  
Built with **Vanilla JS, HTML5, and CSS3**, this app lets you type a user ID (1‚Äì10) and retrieves the user‚Äôs data such as name, email, company, and website.

---

## Features
- Search users by ID (1‚Äì10) using an input form.
- Fetch user data asynchronously from a REST API.
- Loading state & error handling (invalid ID, network issues).
- Modern responsive UI styled with CSS (variables, grid layout, focus states).
- Accessible: semantic HTML structure (`header`, `main`, `footer`) and ARIA attributes.
